Jekyll itself is probably the most popular SSG out there.</p>\n<p>SSGs have gained widespread adoption for a multitude of reasons. Compared to dynamic sites which use a full-stack CMS like Wordpress or are backed by a Node or Ruby server, they render much faster, offer greater security, cost less to run, and scale more easily. Really, a question you should be thinking about these days is, “Do I need to use anything other than a static site?”</p>\n<h3><strong>How to Install Jekyll</strong></h3>\n<p>Jekyll is written in Ruby, and so you’ll need a Ruby development environment to use it. If you’re using MacOS, then Ruby is already included with the most recent versions of the OS.</p>\n<p>You also need Xcode Command Line Tools which provides GCC and GNU Make. These are used to build “native extensions” for Ruby, where some parts of a package are written in C or C++. You can install them using:</p>\n<pre><code>xcode-select --install\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can check which version of Ruby you have installed using:</p>\n<pre><code>ruby -v\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you don’t have it, or are running an old version (anything below 2.3), then the easiest way to update it is using Homebrew. Once you’ve installed Homebrew, run:</p>\n<pre><code>brew install ruby\n</code></pre>\n<p>Ruby ships with a package manager, RubyGems, which you can use to install programs (“gems”) written in Ruby. We’ll use this firstly to install something called Bundler, which helps with dependency management for Ruby gems:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo gem install bundler\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we’re ready to use RubyGems to install Jekyll itself:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo gem install jekyll\n</code></pre>\n<p>For other operating systems, the Jekyll website includes <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/\" title=\"Jekyll Installation\">detailed installation and set-up guides</a> to get you started.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to Use Jekyll</strong></h3>\n<p>Once you’ve installed Jekyll, you can create a new project using the terminal. We’ll also initialise git in the folder we create:</p>\n<pre><code>jekyll new jekyll-site\ncd jekyll-site\ngit init\n</code></pre>\n<p>Jekyll comes with a development server which you can use to run your site locally once you’ve built it.</p>\n<pre><code>bundle exec jekyll serve\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this command, bundle exec instructs Bundle to run the jekyll serve command (which actually fires up the development server) in the context of the current bundle. This means it uses the Gemfile in the current project directory, which describes gem dependencies required to execute Ruby code.</p>\n<p>If you now navigate to <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:4000/\">http://127.0.0.1:4000/</a> in your browser, you’ll see the Jekyll starter project up and running. Once the Jekyll server is running, you can make changes to the project and Jekyll will pick them up and rebuild automatically, so you don’t need to stop and restart the server.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/static/imgages/blogs/assets/build-your-first-site/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-17%20at%2014.41.37.png\"></p>\n<p>With a completed site, you’d tell Jekyll to build the site and output static files to a directory. If you run:</p>\n<pre><code>bundle exec jekyll build\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will output your static site to the _site folder, ready to deploy. You should never manually put files in the _site folder.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a moment to look at the structure of the starter project. It should look like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-17%20at%2014.54.59.png\"></p>\n<p>_config.yml is a file in YAML format which provides metadata for your site, including things like the title. Go ahead and make some changes. You will need to restart the server when you change this file in particular, so go ahead and do so to see your changes in browser. This file also specifies the Jekyll theme we’re using - more on this later.</p>\n<p>index.md and about.md are the two pages of the website. When Jekyll builds your site, it looks for .md (Markdown) files, and compiles them into HTML based on layouts in the theme you are using. If you look at the top of about.md, you can see it specifies which layout should be used for the About page:</p>\n<pre><code>layout: page\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that about.md also includes another line which specifies a URL path for the page when it’s built:</p>\n<pre><code>permalink: /about/\n</code></pre>\n<p>This makes it accessible at <a href=\"http://localhost:4000/about/\">http://localhost:4000/about/</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>How to Post Content to Jekyll</strong></h3>\n<p>You’ll see that the starter site already has a blog post displayed on the homepage. This is being generated from a file in the _posts directory. You can create new files in this directory, and Jekyll will pick them up and build them.</p>\n<p>To create a new post, add a new markdown file with the name formatted as YYYY-MM-DD-title.markdown. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>cd _posts\necho > 2018-09-17-my-first-post.markdown\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let’s add some content to it:</p>\n<pre><code>---\nlayout: post\ntitle:  \"This is my first Jekyll post!\"\ndate:   2018-09-17\n---\n\nThis is the first Jekyll post I have created.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that in the browser, Jekyll constructs URLs for the posts based on the date. If you included a “categories” line at the top of the markdown file, as is the case in the default “Welcome to Jekyll!” post, these would also be used in the URL.</p>\n<p>You can also place draft content in the _drafts folder. These files are named without a date but otherwise similar to your _posts content. Running jekyll serve with the –drafts parameter will include draft content in your site build.</p>\n<p>In practice, unless your site is going to change very infrequently, you probably wouldn’t want to create posts yourself, What you’d be more likely to do is use a headless CMS, which would manage your content and provide markdown to Jekyll in the appropriate format. There are many choices to do this, and a good option might be a git-based CMS which would commit post content to the _posts folder as it’s written.</p>\n<h3><strong>Jekyll Markdown Basics</strong></h3>\n<p>So you now know how to create posts for Jekyll. But what’s with this Markdown format that they use?</p>\n<p>There are two parts to the markdown files. The top section, between the triple hyphens, is referred to as “front matter”. This is essentially metadata about the post which Jekyll uses when building the site, and is in YAML format. We’ve already talked about several of the front matter fields.</p>\n<p>The second part of the files is the markdown itself. Markdown is fairly straightforward to write, with a few minor pieces of syntax to learn. Here are some of the key things you’ll need to know:</p>\n<p>Headings are denoted with # symbols, based on the level of the heading.</p>\n<pre><code># This is a top-level (h1) heading.\n## This is a second-level (h2) heading.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Generally your text will be formatted by the theme rather than the markdown, but there are a few modifications you can make for emphasis:</p>\n<pre><code>*Asterisks* or _underscores_ denote italic emphasis\n**Double asterisks** or __double underscores__ denote bold emphasis\n**These can be _combined_**\n~~Double tildes~~ denote strikethrough.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Lists can be denoted by numbers:</p>\n<pre><code>1. First list item\n2. Second list item\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or can be bulleted:</p>\n<pre><code>* First list item\n* Second list item\n</code></pre>\n<p>Sub-lists are indented with two spaces.</p>\n<p>Links can be embedded in a variety of ways, but most commonly are written inline:</p>\n<pre><code>This is an inline link to [Stackbit](http://stackbit.com).\n</code></pre>\n<p>Images, which you’ll want to place in the site’s assets folder, can also be embedded inline:</p>\n<pre><code>![Photo of Simon](/assets/simon.jpg)\n</code></pre>\n<p>These should be enough to get you started writing posts. There’s more that Markdown can do, and an excellent source of reference for the full syntax is the <a href=\"https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet\" title=\"Markdown Cheatsheet\">Markdown Cheatsheet</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Jekyll Layouts</strong></h3>\n<p>Great, so we can add new pages and posts to our Jekyll site. But the Markdown files we’ve looked at only contain content. The other piece of the puzzle is templating to define the appearance of the pages when they’re built.</p>\n<p>Jekyll layouts are stored in the _layouts folder, and use the Liquid template language which was developed by Shopify. The layout used by a particular post is defined in the front matter for the post, as we saw earlier. Templates take a .html extension and look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!doctype html>\n&#x3C;html lang=\"en\">\n  &#x3C;head>\n    &#x3C;meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    &#x3C;title>{{ page.title }}&#x3C;/title>\n  &#x3C;/head>\n  &#x3C;body>\n    &#x3C;h1>{{ page.title }}&#x3C;/h1>\n    &#x3C;p>{{ content }}&#x3C;/p>\n  &#x3C;/body>\n&#x3C;/html>\n</code></pre>\n<p>When Jekyll builds a page with this template, content from the markdown file being parsed is injected into the HTML in place of the Liquid tags {{ page.title }} and {{ content }}.</p>\n<p>As our templates begin to become more complex, we can also start to place re-usable code into the _includes folder. Partial templates in this folder can be used in your layouts via the {% include .html %} Liquid tag. There’s much more you can do with Liquid templates, and the <a href=\"https://shopify.github.io/liquid/\" title=\"Shopify Liquid Documentation\">official liquid documentation</a> covers their capabilities in extensive detail.</p>\n<p>So this gives us the ability to build HTML pages with our markdown. But they won’t look great right now. We need Jekyll to create some stylesheets for the pages. Jekyll provides build in support for <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com\" title=\"Sass\">Sass</a>. If you create .scss files in a /css/ folder within your Jekyll project, it will automatically compile them to .css files when you build.</p>\n<p>You can also include Sass partials in the _sass folder and reference them via @import in your /css/ Sass assets.</p>\n<h3><strong>Pick Out a Jekyll Theme</strong></h3>\n<p>You could build up the appearance of a site yourself, but Jekyll comes with support for 3rd party themes which you can use for the appearance of your site. Because Jekyll is widely used, there are many themes available to choose from.</p>\n<p>Themes typically come with pre-built content for the assets, _layouts, _includes and _sass directories. - so essentially they’re providing styled layout templates for you. For some themes, you’ll simply download a bundle and extract it to your project directory. One that we like is <a href=\"http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/massively/\" title=\"Massively Jekyll Theme\">Massively</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve extracted the theme to your project directory, run:</p>\n<pre><code>bundle install\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will install any dependencies the theme requires.</p>\n<p>You should check that none of the theme’s files conflict with alternatively-named files which already exist. For example, you probably have an empty index.md file, and Massively comes with an index.html. You want to remove index.md, otherwise it will override Massively’s file.</p>\n<p>Now, fire up the Jekyll server and see the new theme in action.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202018-09-17%20at%2021.04.16.png\"></p>\n<p>You’ll also find Jekyll themes which can be installed as a Ruby gem. In this case, the theme’s files are stored within the gem and hidden from you, rather than appearing in your project directory. The default theme Jekyll uses when you run jekyll new is Minima, but you’ll notice its layouts are not visible in your folder structure.</p>\n<p>To install a gem-based Jekyll theme, we need to add the theme to the project’s Gemfile (it’s usually best to start this with a new project rather than on top of another theme you’ve manually installed):</p>\n<pre><code>gem “jekyll-athena\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then direct your site to use the theme in config.yml:</p>\n<pre><code>theme: jekyll-athena\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, have Bundle install the theme:</p>\n<pre><code>bundle install\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once again, you can fire up the server and see the new theme in action.</p>\n<p>You can also override a gem-based theme’s files by creating copies of its files in the appropriate project directory and modifying them. You can find out where the theme’s files are located by running bundle show with the theme name, such as:</p>\n<pre><code>bundle show jekyll-athena\n</code></pre>\n<p>Regardless of how you install the theme, once you’ve done so, you can get to work tweaking it to your liking and authoring your markdown content, to get your first Jekyll site ready for the world.</p>","pages":[{"url":"/beta/","relativePath":"beta.md","relativeDir":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Beta Application","header":{"type":"header","component":"Header","inversed":true,"displayAction":false},"footer":{"type":"footer","component":"Footer"},"template":"BetaSignUp"}},{"url":"/","relativePath":"index.md","relativeDir":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Stackbit","footer":{"type":"footer","component":"Footer"},"header":{"type":"header","component":"Header","backgroundImage":"images/hero-bg.jpg","inversed":true,"displayAction":true},"sections":[{"name":"hero","type":"heroPrimary","component":"HeroPrimary","title":"Build Modern JAMstack Websites in Minutes","subtitle":"Combine any Theme, Site Generator and CMS without complicated integrations","buttonTitle":"JOIN THE BETA","buttonHref":"/beta/","imageSectionTitle":"Works with","imageSectionImage":"images/mooseheads.png","videoSource":"https://assets.stackbit.com/videos/product-demo.mp4","template":"heroPrimary"},{"name":"stack","type":"stackItems","component":"StackItems","themeLayer":{"icon":"images/stack-items/themes-icon.svg","subtitle":"Start with hundreds of","title":"Quality Themes.","description":"Find the right theme for you or your client's business and hit the ground running with a beautiful, semanatic, and seo-optimized theme.","buttonHref":"/beta/","buttonTitle":"Join the Beta"},"genLayer":{"icon":"images/stack-items/gen-icon.svg","subtitle":"Use your favorite static","title":"Site Generator.","description":"We support all the popular static site generators, use a theme you  like with a site generator you know.","buttonHref":"/beta/","buttonTitle":"Join the Beta"},"cmsLayer":{"icon":"images/stack-items/cms-icon.svg","subtitle":"Select your favorite","title":"CMS of Choice.","description":"Headless CMSs are extremely handy for you and your client  and our themes work with all of them.","buttonHref":"/beta/","buttonTitle":"Join the Beta"},"deploymentLayer":{"icon":"images/stack-items/deployment-icon.svg","subtitle":"Pick your Git hosting and","title":"Click to Deploy.","description":"Your modern project lives as a Git repository.
